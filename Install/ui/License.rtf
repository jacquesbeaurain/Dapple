Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.\par

Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access the Modification.\par

\par
H.      A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software.  A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient.  Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone.  Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.\par
\par
I.      A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

\par
